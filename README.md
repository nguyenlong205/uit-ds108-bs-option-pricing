## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the complete final project report for the subject **Advanced Statistics and Probability**. The project covers the key approach from several statistical and probabilistic methods applied to real-world data - option pricing. It demonstrates the practical application of theories, such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and probability distributions, among others. The report includes detailed explanations, step-by-step calculations, and visualizations to support the findings.
